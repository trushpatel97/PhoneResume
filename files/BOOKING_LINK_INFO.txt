IMPORTANT: Configure Your Booking Link
======================================

The "Book Interview" button is currently set up to open a booking link when clicked.

To make it functional, you need to:

1. Update the link in script.js (around line 4115) in the startBottomRightTypewriter function:
   - Replace 'https://calendly.com/your-link' with your actual booking system URL
   - This could be Calendly, Cal.com, or any other booking service you use

2. The QR code image (images/QRCode.png) should link to the same booking URL
   - Make sure your QR code is generated to point to your booking link

Example booking services:
- Calendly: https://calendly.com/your-username
- Cal.com: https://cal.com/your-username
- Google Calendar appointment slots
- Microsoft Bookings

The QR code will appear automatically after the "Book Interview" text finishes typing.
